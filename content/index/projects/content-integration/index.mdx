This app is a creative writing environment that uses JavaScript logic and DOM manipulation to give the user a focus timer and a place to write while a weather API gathers current weather data based on the userâ€™s desired location, and updates the styling to match. Using a one to many relationship, users can save their writing to their profile where each piece can be viewed and deleted.
