A front-end web game where you can grow a skeleton with tamagotchi inspired game play. Uses JavaScript and DOM manipulation to handle timers with random intervals and the buttons needed to alter the stats of the skeleton. A very much "hand-built" application using just HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and original assets for visuals/audio.
