import Underlining from "../../../src/styles/underlining"

As a full stack developer, I utilize Javascript, CSS, HTML, and React to develop apps that make othersâ€™ lives easier. My unique background as an audio/visual technician gives me the ability to learn quickly; and solve problems while under pressure. As someone who prefers to be multi-talented over hyper focused, I adapt quickly and easily to changes. This and my background gives me a perspective which allows me to see creative solutions that others might not.
